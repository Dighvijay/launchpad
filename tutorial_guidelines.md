# Tutorial Guidelines
Please make sure that you can check off  **every** item on this list before submitting your tutorial.

 - [] The tutorial is written as a Jupyter notebook- see [here](https://jupyter.org/) for more.
 - [] Code or examples are embedded wherever a new concept is introduced.
 - [] All prerequisites are explicitly stated, with links to articles or websites exploring these prerequisites, or explored in the tutorial.
 - [] All dependencies are clearly mentioned, with relevant import instructions.
 - [] Graphics are used to illustrate concepts or examples wherever possible.
 - [] If the tutorial focuses on writing code towards a certain goal, following along with the tutorial and executing all the code cells in the notebook should give the reader a fully function (if toy) version of the tutorial's focus.
